Population Correlation Coefficient measures how two variables are related > two variables equals their covariance divided by the products of their SD

ρ = [ 1 / N ] * Σ { [ (Xi - μX) / σx ]


Python Program: correlation coefficient 
import math 
  
function that returns correlation coefficient. 
def correlationCoefficient(X, Y, n) : 
    sum_X = 0
    sum_Y = 0
    sum_XY = 0
    squareSum_X = 0
    squareSum_Y = 0
      
      
    i = 0
    while i < n : 
        # sum of elements of array X. 
        sum_X = sum_X + X[i] 
          
        # sum of elements of array Y. 
        sum_Y = sum_Y + Y[i] 
          
        # sum of X[i] * Y[i]. 
        sum_XY = sum_XY + X[i] * Y[i] 
          
        # sum of square of array elements. 
        squareSum_X = squareSum_X + X[i] * X[i] 
        squareSum_Y = squareSum_Y + Y[i] * Y[i] 
          
        i = i + 1
       
    use formula for calculating correlation  
    coefficient. 
    corr = (float)(n * sum_XY - sum_X * sum_Y)/
           (float)(math.sqrt((n * squareSum_X - 
           sum_X * sum_X)* (n * squareSum_Y - 
           sum_Y * sum_Y))) 
    return corr 
      
Driver function 
X = [15, 18, 21, 24, 27] 
Y = [25, 25, 27, 31, 32] 
       
Find the size of array. 
n = len(X) 
  
Function call to correlationCoefficient. 
print ('{0:.6f}'.format(correlationCoefficient(X, Y, n))) 

Correlation Coefficient = 0.96
