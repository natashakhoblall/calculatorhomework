Python Code: variance() function of Statistics Module 
  
Importing Statistics module 
import statistics 
  
Creating a sample of data 
sample = [2.74, 1.23, 2.63, 2.22, 3, 1.98] 
  
# Prints variance of the sample set 
  
# Function will automatically calculate 
# it's mean and set it as xbar 
print("Variance of sample set is % s" 
      %(statistics.variance(sample)))

Variance of sample set = 0.4
