 The P value, or the calculated probability, is the probability of finding any observed results when the null hypothesis has been true 


Python Code: P Value/Calculated probability function of Statistics Module 
  
from math import *
from numpy import *
from datascience import *
from scipy import stats



  
Creating a sample of data 
sample = [2.74, 1.23, 2.63, 2.22, 3, 1.98] 
  
# Prints calculated probability of the sample 
# Function will automatically calculate based on the imported datascience function listed below

print(datascience.util.percentile(sample))
