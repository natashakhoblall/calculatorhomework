Population Mean is the average of a set of terms and calculated by taking the sum of all numbers and dividing by the number of terms in the population

μ = (Σ * X)/ N

Python program: 
# mean of elements 
  
# list of elements to calculate mean 
n_num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
n = len(n_num) 
  
get_sum = sum(n_num) 
mean = get_sum / n 
  
print("Mean / Average is: " + str(mean))
